# Graph Segmentation
File structures:  
- ``Graph_Based_Segmentation.ipynb``: main notebook, introduce the basic concept of method.  
- ``source.py``: python source file.
- ``Images``: images folder.
- ``segmented.cpp``, ``segmented.h``,``main.cpp``: source code for ``C++``.


-----------
Notice these features:
- Collected component in Graph (it's too slow). I'm still figure out how to speed it up.
- Write the component list to file for ``Selective Search``.
